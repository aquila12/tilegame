All rights reserved, except where marked as provided under a specific license

Some of the contents of this repository are provided *under different licenses*,
where marked - see the top of each file for information on that module.

If you want to reuse or adapt something that I haven't provided under
permissive license, please ask me.

## Why?

Programming is hard and takes time, and this work (except where marked) is my
own.  That means it's (broadly) my choice what other people are allowed to do
with it.

For support code, I want other people to be able to benefit from it as much as
possible, and I want to make sure that where someone uses that code and improves
upon it, *their improvements are available for other people to use* in the same
way, without further burdening them.

## Choice of License

A brief explanation of some of the licenses I use:

- MIT License: You can use and distribute the modified or unmodified code, but
  you must include the copyright notice and license.

- Eclipse Public License: You can use and distribute the unmodified code, but
  you must include the copyright notice and license.  If you distribute modified
  versions of the code, you must additionally **make the modified source code
  available under the same license**.

Both of these licenses allow you to use and integrate with the code.
